      A tiger is born of a tiger. Dr. Lavingston, the son of Peterlis Odhiambo, carries the legacy of the Kotewas name with unmatched pride. He walks with a focused gaze, speaks with clarity, and acts with intention. Everything he does reflects the core values of his father: never beg, never fear, never follow ‚Äî only lead.
    </p>

    <p>
      At school, in business, and in leadership, Dr. Lavingston shows wisdom beyond his age. He stands firm, commands attention, and earns trust. People know ‚Äî when he speaks, it's with purpose. He is respected not just as a son, but as a man in his own right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like his father, he doesn't chase fame. Fame follows him. He builds, protects, inspires. This is a man who represents the rising generation of lions in Kotewas.
